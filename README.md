# GDPWikiscrape
A program for scraping (with permission) and analysing the pages of the GameplayDesignPatterns.org wiki.

## What it does
The program reads the entire contents of the wiki's pattern and game pages, and extracts the relationships between these pages, as well as saving a trimmed down version of each of the pattern pages with most useless content removed. This is so the data can be later served in my GDP Wiki online browser.

## Outputs
The useful outputs of the program are "AllGames.json" and "AllPatterns.json", these files are used in my GDP Wiki online browser.
This browser can be found here: https://github.com/minichris/VGTropes

## Warning
This program is provided as an example of how a wiki scraper can be implemented and how a tool can analyse pages for infomation relationships can be created. YOU SHOULD NOT RUN THIS TOOL ON GAMEPLAYDESIGNPATTERNS.ORG OR ANY OTHER WIKI WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION FROM THE OWNERS OF THE WIKI.
